In the analysis, we contrasted the weight of two groupsâ€”one with indications of frailty and the other without. 
There was a slight difference in weight, but it wasn't statistically significant, so it might have just been a coincidence. 
Therefore, we cannot say with certainty that in this sample, signs of frailty are highly associated with diminished weight
 To get a more firm conclusion, additional information or a larger study may be required.
